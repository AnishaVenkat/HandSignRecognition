1.Using Opencv mediapipe library and Convolutional neural networks:

Image Collection: The images are collected with real time web-cam using openCV.

All the collected images are preprocessed and passed to  pre-trained Xception convolutional neural networks for better accuracy.

2.For improved accuracy these images are trained using object detection model.

Below are the results:
